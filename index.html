        <p class="lead mb-4"> I am currently a second year Sociology major at the University of California, Riverside. I was raised in the Bay Area and moved to Southern California for school. Moving miles away from home, has shaped the person I am today. Many people don’t get this opportunity that I have now. I took on this challenging opportunity to grow and achieve a higher education that many of my family members and people from my community don’t typically get the opportunity to do.  Living this new independent live has grant me new skills and build on the persona I am today. Because of these new challenges and successes I’ve experienced thus far, I’ve become a passionate, motivated and skillful young adult today.
<br><br> As I continue my journey as an undergraduate, I plan to expand my knowledge and learn more skills that will not only benefit me but my community as well. I am attending college for people who don’t have a voice in our society and are struggling to simply survive on a daily basis.  I'm here for the people who aren’t as lucky as I was to reach a higher education.  As a first generation, from immigrant parents, I see it as my duty to speak up for my community and many others who can’t because of their imigration status. Many people in our society are easy to judge immigrants because they don’t understand the life struggles immigrants experience. In my community, I grew to see men waiting on sidewalks unsure if they would get picked up and have a job for the day. It was normal to see women down the street from our high school working the streets as prostitutes to be able to pay bills. As children we attended low funded school with minimum resources. With the lack of role models and disencouragement from our society, it made us believe that achieving higher education was an unrealistic dream. As a college student, I am now able to see the injustice and inhumane lives we lived in. I learned that it’s not normal to sit in class for a whole period with no teacher showing up. Or how having a substitute for a whole year because of lack of teachers is definitely not ok. Now that I am here, I want a career path that will help me uplift low income communities and families. I want to change the injustices that many communities like mine are forced to live in.
